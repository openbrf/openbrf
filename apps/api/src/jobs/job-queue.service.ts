 * Prisma's. Sharing was tried first, via pg-boss's `fromPrisma` adapter, and
 * it does not work against Prisma 7: pg-boss checks whether its schema is
 * installed with a query that returns a `regclass` column, and Prisma's raw
 * query interface cannot deserialize that type, so `start()` throws before the
 * queue exists. The dedicated pool is the supported configuration, and it also
 * buys back LISTEN/NOTIFY wakeups instead of polling. It is capped low because
 * one association is 20 to 200 households.
 *
 * Schema installation is not done by the running application in production.
 * The application role deliberately holds no CREATE privilege, so the pgboss
 * schema is installed at deploy time by the owner and the app starts with
 * migrate disabled.
